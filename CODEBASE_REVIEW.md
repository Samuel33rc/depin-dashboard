## ❌ ISSUES & INCONSISTENCIES

### 1. Naming Issues
| Issue | Current | Should Be |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Package name | `helium-dashboard` | `depin-ops` |
| Project folder | `helium-dashboard/` | `depin-ops/` |
| Some mentions | "DePIN Dashboard" | "DePIN Ops" |

### 2. Missing/Incomplete Features
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Pro/Paid features | ❌ Not implemented | Landing shows $9/mo but nothing is paid-locked |
| Email notifications | ❌ Not implemented | Listed in Pro but no code |
| Priority support | ❌ Not implemented | Just a button "Coming Soon" |

### 3. Technical Issues
| Issue | Severity | Fix |
|-------|----------|-----|
| Waitlist file lost on Vercel | High | Known - Discord backup works |
| Demo wallet has no real rewards | Medium | Using mock data |
| No favicon | Low | Missing |
| No meta tags | Low | SEO not optimized |

### 4. Code Inconsistencies
- Some files still use `axios` import (but removed from dependencies) - need to verify
- Some old comments in code may reference old naming

### 5. Documentation Issues
- SETUP_DISCORD.md has placeholder "your-domain.vercel.app"
- README.md has old "helium-dashboard" references
- competition-analysis.md is basic, needs updating
